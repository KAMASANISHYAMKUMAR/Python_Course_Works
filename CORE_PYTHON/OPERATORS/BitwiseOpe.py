Bitwise operators are used to perform
the operations on binary digits | bits

x=10 -->  1 0 1 0  --> 0 - F and 1 - T
y=11 -->  1 0 1 1

bitwise and (&)
    - works as same as logical and
    1 0 1 0
    1 0 1 1
==========
    1 0 1 0
print(x&y)
    
bitwise or ( | )
    - works as same as logical or
    1 0 1 0
    1 0 1 1
==========
    1 0 1 1
print(x|y)

bitwise xor
- When both bits are different it will return 1 else 0
    1 0 1 0
    1 0 1 1
==========
    0 0 0 1    
print(x^y)


bitwise left shift
bitwise right shift
