Data tyes In C-Language:
    Predefined Data types
        Integer
            signed int
            unsigned int
            long int
            unsigned long
            
        Real
            float | double | long double
        
        Character Types
            signed char | unsigned char 
        
    Abstract Data types
        Arrays and pointer
        
    Userdefined Data types.
          union | enum | typedef | struct

     Java Data types :
           Primitive Data types
           Reference Types        
          
Data types
   - Every Data type is a class
       int   -->   <class 'int'>
            x=10
            type(x)   #<class 'int'>

   - Every Class is a data type ?
     Ans: yes.

   - Data types are classified into 3 types
               1.Value Types
                   - can store a value
                   Eg:  Number Types :
                             int | float | complex 
                   Non Number Types :
                             bool | None
                             
               2.Collection Types
                       - can store group of values
                       - These are also known as
                            Predefined DS | Sequences |  iterables

                    Eg:  str | list | tuple | set | dict .....
                                           
               3.Binary Types.
                     - These are used to store binary data.
                     - Mostly used for Media Related Files.
                                 Image, Object, A | V Files.

                        Eg:  bytes | bytearray

            -  In Python Memory Every thing will be
            stored in the form an object | Memory Block.

            - Objects are classified into 2 types
                     1.mutable objects
                     
                     2.immutable objects
                         Eg:  str | tuple | int | float | complex | bool

         - Objects are dynamic in size.


    int
       - If any variable which is assigned with a number +ve | -ve
       without decimal value are treated by the system
       as int type.
              x=123
              y=2333434
              z=-34567

       - Predefined class  for int type <class 'int'>
