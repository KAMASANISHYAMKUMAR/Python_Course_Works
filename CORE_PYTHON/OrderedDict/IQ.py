  What is difference between dict ve OrderedDict
      both dict or OrderedDict are almost same with
      one small difference

      * Values will be stored in the form of key and value
      * we can create dict collection by using
            dict( )
            dict(iterable)

     * We can create OrderedDict( ) by using
     OrderedDict( ) from collections module

     import collections
     d=collections.OrderedDict()

    Note: All methods of dict we can use into OrderedDict
    collection.

    Dict collection is Unordered Collection
    Where as OrderedDict id ordered
    insertion order of items are maintained.

    Note: Upto Python 3.4 Dict is unordered collection
    from 3.5 onwards dict is also ordered Collection.
