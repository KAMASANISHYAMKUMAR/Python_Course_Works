     - Defining the Exception class is
     nothing but creating sub class
     of class Exception

     class Sample:
          pass

    class Sample(ABC):
        pass

    class Sample(Exception):
       pass

    - Define a parameterized constructor in the
    Userdefined Exception class. For Displying the
    Exception name and Exception Description

    - Based on the application req we have to raise
                               Userdefined Exception Explicitly
