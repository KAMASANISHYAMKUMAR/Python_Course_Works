Polymorphism

   Example :  +

   int + int => addition | sum
   10+20
      30
       
   str + str => concatenation | str
   "sai"+"baba"
      "saibaba"

   In Other Languages polymorphism classified into 2
          1.Compile-time poly
          2.Run-time Poly

   In Python Polymorphism can be done by
      1.Constructor overloading
             - In Other Languages
                  Constructor overloading is the process
                  of defining more than one constructor
                  for different purpose.
                  
      2.Method overloading
            - In Other Languages
                  Method overloading is the process of
                  defining more than one method with same
                  name for different purpose.

      
      3.Constructor overriding
           - Process of defining the sub class constructor
           same as super class constructor

           - In this case priority is given to sub class
           constructor.If u want call the super class
           constructor then we have to use

                super().__init__([arguments])

            - Constrcutors are inherited
      
      4.Method Overriding
             - Process of defining the sub class method
                                        same as super class method

            - In this case priority is given to sub class
            method only, If u want call the super class
            method then we have to use

                 super().methodname([list of args])

            When do we go for method Overring ?
            - Whenever u want use the super class methods
            into the subclass with different implementation.
