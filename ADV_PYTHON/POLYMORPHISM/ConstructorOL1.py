Polymorphism

   Example :  +

   int + int => addition | sum
   10+20
      30
       
   str + str => concatenation | str
   "sai"+"baba"
      "saibaba"

   In Other Languages polymorphism classified into 2
          1.Compile-time poly
          2.Run-time Poly

   In Python Polymorphism can be done by
      1.Constructor overloading
             - In Other Languages
                  Constructor overloading is the process
                  of defining more than one constructor
                  for different purpose.
                  
      2.Method overloading
      3.Constructor overriding
      4.Method Overriding
      5.Operator overloading
